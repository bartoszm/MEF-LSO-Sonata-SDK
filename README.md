# MEF-LSO-Sonata-SDK (R4)

This repository contains the MEF LSO Sonata SDK.

This SDK release aligns the API schemas and definitions for Serviceability (Address Validation, Site Queries, Product Offering Qualification) and Product Inventory to the latest versions of MEF 79 and MEF 81 Draft Standards. In addition, the API schemas and definitions for Product Order are aligned with the new version of other Sonata APIs. The latest versions of MEF 79 and MEF 81 Draft Standards are included.

MEF LSO Sonata SDK includes API definitions for the following functional areas:

*  Serviceability (Address, Service Site, and Product Offering Qualification Management)
*  Product Quote
*  Product Order
*  Product Inventory

It also holds Payload Descriptions for the following structures that are used with these APIs
*  JSON representations for Product Spec descriptions (initially for MEF Access E-Line services)
*  JSON representations for the UNI attributes (sourced from MEF 57.1)

The MEF LSO Sonata SDK is released under the Apache 2.0 license.

## Maturity Level
The API files contained in this SDK are evolving and subject to change.  They are based on documents that are either ratified standards, or draft standards that have not yet completed the review cycles and approvals necessary to achieve the status as a MEF standard.  MEF is making these publicly available at this time to invite wider industry review.

## Tool support

MEF provides a convenient mechanism to automatically generate code bindings for Sonata POQ. The tool is containerized thus can be easily used at any machine with support for docker-based containerization.

### Build the image from definition 
The docker image use a [simple tool](https://github.com/bartoszm/codegen-wrapper) that in essence is an openAPI codegen with extensions that allow user to dynamically binding of API and product spec definitions.
First step in the process is building an image from definition   

```
docker image build --tag codegen .
```

### Generate code integrated spec

The tool can generate to any output format supported by [openAPI-generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators) project. The command syntax is following:
```
docker run --rm -it -v <your-output>:/opt/MEF/out codegen generate -c <codegen-config> -i ./api/<api-definition> -p payload_descriptions/ProductSpecDescription/<product-spec>
```
and the details for `generate` command can be displayed using:
```
docker run --rm -it -v out:/opt/MEF/out codegen help generate
```
which are:
```
NAME
        openapi-generator-wrapper-cli generate - Generate code using
        configuration.

SYNOPSIS
        openapi-generator-wrapper-cli generate
                (-c <configuration file> | --config <configuration file>)
                (-i <spec file> | --input-spec <spec file>)
                [(-m <model to be augmented> | -model-name <model to be augmented>)]
                [(-p <product specifications> | --product-spec <product specifications>)...]

OPTIONS
        -c <configuration file>, --config <configuration file>
            Path to configuration file configuration file. It can be json or
            yaml.If file is json, the content should have the format
            {"optionKey":"optionValue", "optionKey1":"optionValue1"...}.If file
            is yaml, the content should have the format optionKey:
            optionValueSupported options can be different for each language. Run
            config-help -g {generator name} command for language specific config
            options.

        -i <spec file>, --input-spec <spec file>
            location of the OpenAPI spec, as URL or file (required)

        -m <model to be augmented>, -model-name <model to be augmented>
            Model which will be hosting product specific extensions (E.g.
            ProductCharacteristics)

        -p <product specifications>, --product-spec <product specifications>
            sets of product specification you would like to integrate
```

The tool offers three example configurations for spring server, python client, and aggregated open API definition.
So if you want to generate spring server side code binding for Product Offering Qualification management API together with all product specs available you can use following command:
```
docker run --rm -it -v out:/opt/MEF/out codegen generate -c configurations/spring-server-example.yaml -i ./api/Serviceability/MEF_api_productOfferingQualificationManagement_3.0.1.yaml -p payload_descriptions/ProductSpecDescription/MEF_UNISpec_v3.json -p 
payload_descriptions/ProductSpecDescription/MEF_ELineSpec_v3.json
```

If you prefer you can attach to docker CLI and go in interactive mode:
```
docker run --rm -it -v out:/opt/MEF/out --entrypoint /bin/bash codegen
```

And then to replicate above codegen use:
```
root@3a2dfb6eef20:/opt/MEF# java -jar wrapper.jar generate -c configurations/spring-server-example.yaml -i ./api/Serviceability/MEF_api_productOfferingQualificationManagement_3.0.1.yaml -p payload_descriptions/ProductSpecDescription/MEF_UNISpec_v3.json -p payload_descriptions/ProductSpecDescription/MEF_ELineSpec_v3.json
```


## Reference Implementations

**1) LSO Sonata APIs (older version) implementation on Buyer side - contributed by Amdocs**

   The example implementation of MEF LSO Sonata APIs on Buyer side provided by Amdocs. This example code is part of the solution between a Tier1 North American operator, Amdocs and a UK provider that was put into production in April 2019 to enable the automated ordering of Ethernet services.
   
   This LSO Sonata reference implementation is available on GitHub for MEF Members:

Additionally contact the [LSO Developer Community Manager](mailto:community_manager@mef.net) to request the immediate access.
   
   **NOTE:** This example LSO Sonata implementation does not provide an executable or runnable project and it is based on the older APIs version published in the "2018-dev-preview" release of the LSO Sonata SDK which is available here:
